/**
 * Teardown vs user-exit funnel (issue #12): the DSH launcher's boot-time
 * recompose disposes every cordis entry once, which unmounts the Ink
 * instance and settles waitUntilExit — the exact sequence a user exit
 * produces. Before the fix both paths ran the full leave sequence
 * (resume marker + disposeRootAndExit), so the process exited 0 with no
 * error mid-recompose: "flash back to bash, no error message".
 *
 * This script drives the exported funnel directly and asserts:
 * 1. teardown → handleExit: onUserExit never runs (process would live on);
 * 2. teardown → handleExit(error): error path is gated too;
 * 3. plain handleExit: onUserExit runs exactly once (exited latch);
 * 4. handleExit(error): the error reaches onUserExit.
