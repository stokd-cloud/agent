/**
 * Contract verifier for the #185 follow-up fix (MessageList unseen-count
 * report): onUnseenCount must fire ONLY when the reported count changes.
 *
 * Why this matters: the report calls the parent's setUnseenCount. Under dense
 * streaming commits, pending passive effects flush INSIDE the next commit, so
 * a same-value report dispatches an in-commit setState whose SyncLane stays
 * pending at the commit epilogue — React's nested-update counter climbs, and
 * 50+ consecutive dirty commits crash with React error #185 (post-#146 this
 * chain, not the measure tick, was the live one). The ref gate in MessageList
 * breaks it by never re-reporting an unchanged count.
 *
 * A/B: on unpatched HEAD every no-op commit re-reports (fails here); patched
 * reports the settled value once (passes). Production mode like the
 * measure-depth verifier.
