/**
 * Building the session list.
 *
 * One resolution path produces one complete, honestly-classified record per
 * stored session — every kind, empties included — and callers decide what to
 * show. That split is deliberate: the old picker filtered while it resolved,
 * so "hide sub-agent runs" and "resolve a title" were the same pass and
 * neither could change without disturbing the other. Here the browser can
 * toggle sub-agent runs into view, or offer to clean up boot artifacts,
 * without re-deriving anything.
 *
 * Cost: one `stat` per session always, plus one bounded log read per session
 * whose revision moved since the last listing. On a warm index that is zero
 * log reads. A log whose opening prompt exceeds the cheap window takes one
 * progressive, memory-bounded recovery scan and caches the result. The path
 * this replaces decompressed every frame of the twenty most recent logs on
 * every open — 3.9 s over a 31 MB history.
