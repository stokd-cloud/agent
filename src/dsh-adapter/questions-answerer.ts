 * Prepare the answerer against whichever upstream API the active package
 * exposes. The legacy path registers immediately and binds the returned
 * disposer to this TUI fiber. The waterfall path returns a late binder because
 * channel.agentId changes across `/new`, `/resume`, and rewind.
 *
 * Agentless waterfall requests are claimed deliberately: dsh-auth's `/auth`
 * wizard asks through the same service without an agent. Foreign-agent
 * requests continue to the next answerer.
 *
 * Security scope (#586): the provider-seat guard (DUPLICATE_PROVIDER probe +
 * private symbol check) exists ONLY on the legacy path. The waterfall has no
 * seat. Agent-bearing requests are scope-filtered; agentless requests such as
 * dsh-auth `/auth` are dispatched without a scope carrier. Under the answerer
 * contract, the first eligible listener that returns instead of delegating
 * with `next()` claims the request. Cordis waterfall is around middleware,
 * however: an outer listener can call `next()` and then observe, replace, or
 * reject the downstream result, while `{ prepend: true }` inserts a listener
 * at the front. Upstream exposes no supported way to discover or reserve an
 * exclusive claimant, so the legacy guard and its warning cannot be
 * reproduced here.
