/**
 * Trajectory projection — the data contract shared by the adapter-side fold
 * and the UI-side scene (issue #80 evolution).
 *
 * Two rules shape every type here, and both exist because the projection
 * feeds a terminal that repaints on a keystroke:
 *
 * 1. **Nodes carry references, never derived copies.** A node's `detail` is
 *    the raw event string exactly as the log holds it — JS strings are
 *    immutable and shared, so keeping one costs a pointer, while flattening
 *    or truncating it at fold time would allocate a second copy of every
 *    tool argument in the session AND bake in a width the terminal has not
 *    chosen yet. The view calls {@link previewText} on the ~15 rows it is
 *    about to paint; everything else stays untouched.
 * 2. **Full content is never held at all.** `seq`/`endSeq` address the
 *    owning events, and the inspector re-reads them from the session's own
 *    immutable snapshot on demand. The projection is an index, not a mirror.
