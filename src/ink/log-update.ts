    // IDEs 2025.2+) repaints a view row only when its model cells change,

    // only the cells that changed since the previous frame — so a row the
    // block renderer misrendered mid-frame (partial reflow) is never
    // touched again, and the garbage persists and accumulates as the
    // transcript streams and scrolls: the "works in VS Code, slowly garbles
    // in JetBrains" symptom. xterm.js-family terminals (VS Code) repaint
    // the fixed grid on every write, so the same byte stream is clean
    // there; the model-level state is identical on both (verified by
    // replaying captured frame bytes through the IDE's bundled JediTerm
    // emulator against xterm.js) — the divergence is purely the view
    // layer's incremental repaint.
    //
    // The rewrite runs AFTER the incremental writes instead of replacing
    // them: the growth path's CR+LF writes are what scroll scrolled-off
    // rows into the terminal's native scrollback (inline mode's whole
    // point). A pure full-repaint mode would never emit those scrolls and
    // the transcript above the viewport would vanish. Appending a repaint

    // frame tail) overwrites every application cell, forcing the block
    // renderer to a correct full repaint without touching scrollback or
    // shell output above a short frame. The appended slice lands its
    // row-ending CR+LFs inside the viewport so nothing extra scrolls. The
    // anchor prefixes SGR_RESET + link('') so the ED0's BCE fill uses the
    // default background and any hyperlink the incremental writes left open
    // is closed first. Frames that took a full-reset path already repaint
    // everything and are skipped. A one-row viewport has no separate park

/**
 * Anchored tail repaint for shrink-to-fit frames — the fix for the
 * duplicated-whale/duplicated-transcript family. When growth pushed frame
 * rows into terminal scrollback and a shrink then brings the frame back
 * below the viewport, repainting the whole (short) frame from the viewport
 * top re-prints rows whose originals already sit in scrollback — the user
 * scrolls up and sees every pre-shrink row twice.
 *
 * Two layouts, decided by content:
 *  - The new frame's top rows are UNCHANGED from the previous frame (the
 *    common small shrink — a fold, a spinner unmounting): those rows
 *    already live in scrollback and keep their originals. Erase the
 *    viewport in place (no 2J — history untouched) and repaint ONLY the
 *    changed tail, anchored at the viewport BOTTOM so the frame continues
 *    the scrollback seamlessly. The leading blank band is recorded as
 *    `anchoredPad` so later frames' viewportY math skips the scrollback
 *    rows and relative addressing stays consistent (the band scrolls away
 *    naturally as the next turn grows).
 *  - The frame's top content CHANGED (a panel collapsing, 38 rows → 2):
 *    nothing in scrollback represents the new frame — repaint the whole
 *    short frame top-anchored, matching a fresh render (collapse-shrink's
 *    contract), pad 0.

 * frame), so the viewport top is exactly viewportHeight-1 rows up. Walk
 * there, erase to the end of the screen, and repaint the frame's tail
 * directly into the viewport. Nothing scrolls: no rows are pushed into
 * (WT semantics) or spliced out of (xterm.js semantics) the terminal
 * scrollback, so the shrink frames that fire on EVERY turn — thinking
 * fold, spinner/esc-hint rows unmounting at end of turn, streaming
 * markdown reflow — stop depositing a full stale UI copy per turn into
 * the user's scroll history (issues #38 #39 #19).
 *
 * Frame-row bookkeeping stays on the steady-state formulas: the repaint
 * leaves frame rows [H-min(H,V-1), H) on the viewport with the cursor at
 * frame row H on the physical bottom row — exactly the mapping viewportY
 * derives (viewport top = H-V+1 when H >= V), so the next frame needs no
 * special casing. Cost is O(viewport) cells once per shrink frame, well
 * under the fullReset path it replaces (whole frame + 10000-row scroll).
 *
 * Also reused by the viewport re-anchor (requestViewportReanchor), where
 * the cursor may NOT be exactly on the park row — a third-party write
 * left it somewhere in the bottom region. The CR + cursorUp(V-1) still
 * lands on the viewport top because CUU clamps at the top margin, so the
 * repaint re-syncs the mapping from any bottom-region start. (On legacy
 * conhost the clamp can drag the viewport instead — see
 * hasCursorUpViewportYankBug — but only when the cursor starts above the
