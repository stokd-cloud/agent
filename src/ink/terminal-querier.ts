/**
 * Query the terminal and await responses without timeouts.
 *
 * Terminal queries (DECRQM, DA1, OSC 11, etc.) share the stdin stream
 * with keyboard input. Response sequences are syntactically
 * distinguishable from key events, so the input parser recognizes them
 * and dispatches them here.
 *
 * To avoid timeouts, each query batch is terminated by a DA1 sentinel
 * (CSI c) — every terminal since VT100 responds to DA1, and terminals
 * answer queries in order. So: if your query's response arrives before
 * DA1's, the terminal supports it; if DA1 arrives first, it doesn't.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const [sync, grapheme] = await Promise.all([
 *     querier.send(decrqm(2026)),
 *     querier.send(decrqm(2027)),
 *     querier.flush(),
 *   ])
 *   // sync and grapheme are DECRPM responses or undefined if unsupported
