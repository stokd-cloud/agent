/**
 * External editor round-trip for the prompt input (issue #123): Ctrl+G dumps
 * the current draft into a temp file, hands the terminal to `$VISUAL` /
 * `$EDITOR` (nvim, vim, nano, `code --wait`, …), and returns the saved text
 * for the input to adopt.
 *
 * Terminal handover reuses the Ink core's editor handoff pair —
 * `enterAlternateScreen()` pauses rendering, suspends raw-mode stdin, and
 * drops the extended key reporting that non-CSI-u editors (nano) choke on;
 * `exitAlternateScreen()` re-enters the alt screen (vim's rmcup pops back to
 * the main screen on quit), repaints, and resumes stdin. See ink.tsx. The
 * saved file is read back BEFORE stdin is resumed: resuming earlier would
 * let keystrokes typed right at editor exit race the prompt's `setValue`
 * and get overwritten. The restore is attempted whenever the handover was
 * attempted (a partially-failed enter still gets an exit pass), and a
 * failing restore never overrides the outcome.
 *
 * Editor resolution order mirrors readline's edit-and-execute-command:
 * `$VISUAL` → `$EDITOR`. There is deliberately NO fallback editor: an
 * unresolved editor reports `unavailable` and the UI asks the user to set
 * `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` (dropping someone into an unconfigured `vi` is a
 * trap for users who don't know how to quit it). The variable may carry
 * arguments (`EDITOR="code --wait"`), so the command line is split
 * quote-aware before spawning.
 *
 * Windows launch: libuv resolves bare names to `.exe` on PATH but will NOT
 * execute `.cmd`/`.bat` shims (VS Code's `code` on PATH is `code.cmd`), and
 * `spawn(..., {shell: true})` with arguments triggers DEP0190 on Node 24+.
 * So bare commands are resolved against PATH/PATHEXT up front, and shim
 * scripts go through an explicit `$comspec /d /s /c` whose payload is built
 * with the cross-spawn quoting protocol (vendored in shellQuote.ts) and
 * passed with `windowsVerbatimArguments: true` — without verbatim, libuv
 * re-quotes the already-quoted payload and corrupts paths containing
 * spaces (a stock VS Code install path has them).
