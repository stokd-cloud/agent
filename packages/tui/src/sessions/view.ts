/**
 * The session browser's view model.
 *
 * Every decision about *which* sessions are on screen and in what order lives
 * here, as one pure function from the full list plus the current filters to a
 * flat list of rows. Two reasons it is shaped that way:
 *
 * - Filtering is where this feature's bugs were. Keeping it pure means the
 *   truth table — a sub-agent run is hidden, an unrelated rewind fork is not,
 *   a boot artifact is hidden but counted — is checkable without rendering
 *   anything.
 * - Rows are flattened rather than nested. A windowed list of variable-height
 *   groups has to guess how much room each group needs; a flat list of
 *   single-line rows is windowed by arithmetic, and the group headers simply
 *   travel with their sessions.
