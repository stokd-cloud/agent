 * instead of the repository the user is working in. The default now walks
 * up from the launch directory to the nearest git worktree root (the
 * workspace a coding agent is expected to operate on, Codex-style), falling
 * back to the launch directory itself outside any worktree. An explicit
 * cordis.yml `cwd` always wins.
