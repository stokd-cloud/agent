/**
 * Trajectory motion — five verbs, one shared clock, one hard rule.
 *
 * ## The rule: SGR-only
 *
 * The renderer diffs frames cell by cell and emits the smallest patch that
 * reconciles them. A cell whose *style* changed costs a few bytes of SGR; a
 * row whose *layout* changed costs a full row rewrite, and in inline mode a
 * frame that got shorter takes the full-reset path that once deposited a copy
 * of the whole UI into scrollback on every repaint (issues #38/#39/#19/#10).
 *
 * So every verb below animates colour and colour only. Nothing here changes a
 * glyph count, a row count, or a box dimension. `verify-trace-motion` asserts
 * this mechanically by capturing the write stream across a hundred ticks and
 * failing on any row-level escape — the rule is machine-enforced, not a
 * convention someone has to remember.
 *
 * ## The verbs
 *
 * | verb        | shape                      | used for                        |
 * |-------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
 * | `arrive`    | one bright frame, settle   | a row or wave column just landed |
 * | `reproject` | dim → bright, two frames   | the same data, re-sorted/filtered |
 * | `alert`     | two flashes, then steady   | an error, a retry, a pending ask |
 * | `alive`     | slow breath, loops         | the running edge (1–2 cells max) |
 * | `navigate`  | *nothing*                  | cursor, viewport, inspector      |
 *
 * `navigate` having no animation is a decision, not an omission: easing on a
 * cursor is latency you can feel, and key auto-repeat already supplies the
 * sense of continuity.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * No timer is created here. The scene subscribes once to the Ink core's
 * shared animation clock, which already pauses when the terminal loses focus
 * or the view scrolls offscreen — so an idle session animates nothing.
