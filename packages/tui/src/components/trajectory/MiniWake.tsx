/**
 * The mini wake — the whole session as a dozen glyphs in the status line.
 *
 * This is the conversation's only permanent mention that a second view of the
 * session exists, and it is deliberately not a label. A chip that says
 * `trajectory · ctrl+t` is read once and then becomes furniture; a strip that
 * *shows the session's shape* keeps earning its columns, because the shape
 * changes. Density says how hard the session is working, colour says at what,
 * a red column says something broke, and the breathing edge says it is still
 * going. Wanting to zoom in on that is a more reliable motivation than being
 * told a key exists.
 *
 * It also subsumes the unread-failure badge it replaces: a failure is already
 * a red column here, in the position where it happened, which is strictly more
 * information than a count in the corner.
 *
 * Cost is one row of nothing (it shares the hint row) and, at the default
 * width, sixteen columns. The band itself is memoized by the caller against
 * the row count, so a frame that only ticks the animation clock re-colours
 * these cells and computes nothing.
