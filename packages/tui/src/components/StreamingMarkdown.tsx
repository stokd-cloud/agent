/**
 * Tail budget for the unstable suffix during streaming. The sticky view only
 * ever shows the last viewport of rows, but the suffix Text is re-wrapped
 * every frame — an unbounded suffix (a single huge paragraph with no block
 * boundary to advance the prefix) made that O(total) per frame. The suffix
 * is clipped to this many characters (preferring a paragraph boundary),
 * with a leading marker naming the dropped amount; settling renders the
 * full text once through the non-streaming path.
 *
 * The cut point is STICKY (advances only when the suffix outgrows budget +
 * step): a cut that slid every frame would break append-only growth, and
 * the layout layer's incremental wrap would fall back to a full re-wrap of
 * the whole tail on every token.
