/**
 * What the TUI knows about a persisted session before opening it.

 * `{ id, title, cwd, createdAt, updatedAt }`, and every defect it had was
 * downstream of that: it could not tell a delegated sub-agent run from a
 * conversation because it never carried the distinction, and it could not show
 * why a row was labelled the way it was because the label arrived without its
 * provenance. So the types below carry both — the kind as a closed sum, and
 * every derived label together with the evidence that produced it.

 * for the defect that started this work — `origin` and `parentSession` reached
 * the picker and were dropped on the floor.
 *
 * The discriminator is `origin`, never `parentSession`. A `/rewind` fork
 * carries `parentSession` and no `origin`, so filtering on lineage alone would
 * silently hide the user's own rewound branches along with the sub-agents.
