/**
 * Resize reflow regression — the inline frame after a resize must equal a
 * fresh render at the new size.
 *
 * Reported from a real terminal: open a long conversation, then maximize the
 * window. The context bar repaints at the new width while the two status rows
 * under it stay laid out for the old one — the session title truncates
 * mid-word and right-aligned content stops in the middle of the line.
 *
 * Two independent mechanisms turned out to sit behind that, one per axis of
 * the resize, and this file caught both:
 *
 * 1. **Stale measurements.** A resize invalidates every cached measurement in
 *    the tree, because each was taken against a width that no longer exists —
 *    yet nothing is dirty in the reconciler's sense, since no props changed.
 *    `markDirty` walks *upward* from a changed node, so it cannot express
 *    this; the invalidation has to run down to the leaves. Without it the text
 *    nodes keep answering with their old sizes and any row that distributes
 *    space by flex arbitration comes out assembled from two layouts.
 * 2. **A top-anchored repaint that overflows.** The full reset blanks the
 *    viewport, homes the cursor and paints downward, but painted the whole
 *    frame regardless of height. Every row ends in CR+LF and the bottom row is
 *    reserved for the cursor park, so once the frame is as tall as the
 *    viewport the last row is carried off the bottom. Narrowing at a fixed row
 *    count is what makes a frame reach full height — content wraps onto more
 *    rows while the row count stays put — which is why that direction lost the
 *    status hint and widening never did.
 *
 * The oracle is final-state equivalence, which needs no theory of the bug and
 * is why both were found rather than only the one that was being looked for:
 * drive a resize, then build the same state fresh at the new size, and demand
 * the two screens match. Anything the resize path forgot shows up as a diff.
 *
 * It also disproved a third, very plausible theory — that `renderNodeToOutput`
 * was blitting cells out of a previous screen laid out at the old geometry.
 * Disabling the blit source entirely left every case failing exactly as before.
 *
 * The earlier version of this check passed while the bug was live, because it
 * sized the emulator to the widest case up front — so no line ever reflowed.
 * The emulator must be resized for real, which is why `term.resize` is called
 * here with the same dimensions handed to the app.
 *
 * Run: node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-resize-reflow.tsx
