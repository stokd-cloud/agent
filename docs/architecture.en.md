## Runtime path

```text
Cordis profile
  -> src/index.ts (plugin contract and Schema)
  -> src/dsh-adapter/plugin.ts (services, Agent, and React lifecycle)
  -> DSH Agent / session / tool services
  -> src/dsh-adapter/channel.ts (session/event -> Channel)
  -> src/screens/Chat.tsx (keyboard and mode orchestration)
  -> src/components/* (views)
  -> src/ui.ts (themed renderer facade)
  -> src/ink/* + Yoga (layout, terminal protocol, differential output)
  -> ANSI terminal
```

## Module ownership

| Module | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/index.ts` | Cordis plugin name, injection declaration, config interface, and Schema; keep the entry small and lazy |
| `src/dsh-adapter/plugin.ts` | TTY guard, service assembly, Agent create/resume, React mount, and the single cleanup funnel |
| `src/dsh-adapter/questions-answerer.ts` / `preset-resolution.ts` | Prerelease dispatch for user questions and agent presets; consumers stay unaware of upstream version branches |
| `src/dsh-adapter/channel.ts` | DSH event projection plus submit, steer, resume, rewind, model, and preset actions |
| `src/workspaces.ts` | Local-path fallback and generic workspace-provider registry; it must contain no provider protocol, copy, or dependency |
| `src/screens/Chat.tsx` | Modal precedence, global keys, scroll/search/selection state, and slash dispatch |
| `src/components/` | User views and design-system primitives; no Agent or session source of truth |
| `src/ui.ts` | Themed `Box`/`Text`, render, selection, scroll, and other public TUI primitives |
| `src/theme.ts`, `src/themeCatalog.ts` | Built-in, static JSON, and runtime plugin theme resolution and catalog ordering |
| `src/dsh-adapter/themes.ts` | The `ctx.tuiThemes` theme seam, registration lifecycle, and private host facade |
| `src/ink/` | Ported Ink renderer, terminal protocol, events, selection, and Yoga bridge; sensitive infrastructure |
| `src/native-ts/yoga-layout/` | Pure JS/TS layout implementation |
| `cordis.patch.yml` | Profile bundle layer, service rows, overrides, and mount ordering |

Do not duplicate DSH Agent, session, or tool services in a component. Connect new
capability through an existing service, registry, or channel seam.

Workspace extensions follow a one-way dependency: the TUI publishes only a
structural provider interface, while optional plugins register URIs, display
metadata, and command executors. Theme extensions follow the same rule: plugins
register complete semantic palettes through `ctx.tuiThemes`; the host owns
validation, ordering, rendering, and lifecycle, and plugins never rewrite the
theme directory or host palette. Protocol parsing and external connections
belong entirely to the plugin. Removing a plugin must leave local workspaces
and session flows free of missing configuration, placeholders, or fallback
branches.

## The session log is the source of truth

`channel.ts` does not treat a React-local array as conversation truth. DSH
`session/event` records own:

- initial replay and incremental streaming events;
- assistant/reasoning/tool association and sequence anchors;
- rewind turn boundaries;
- reconstruction after resume, export, compact, and fork.

The Channel keeps a TUI-sized projection. Once a long transcript exceeds its
window, older rows fold into short previews while the complete content remains
in the session log and can be restored from events. Tool results are associated
by `callId`, never guessed from array position.

## Rendering and long-session performance

- **Differential output**: each frame writes only screen changes and uses
  capability detection to choose synchronized output, cursor, and Windows
  Terminal paths.
- **Message virtualization**: off-screen rows use the last measured fixed-height
  placeholder and do not participate in the full layout subtree.
- **Replay coalescing**: consecutive token chunks are merged during history
  replay, avoiding repeated string growth for long streamed messages.
- **Bounded caches**: transcript, render-node, and measurement caches are bounded;
  removing a bound requires measured evidence.
- **Display-cell width**: ANSI escapes, combining marks, emoji, and East Asian
  wide characters use terminal cell width, not JavaScript `string.length`.

When changing `src/ink/` or Yoga, run the CI questionnaire/tool-card regressions
and the affected scroll, resize, copy-on-select, or PTY harness. Do not print
diagnostics to an active TUI's stdout; use stderr `DSH_TUI_DEBUG` or
`DSH_TUI_RENDER_LOG`.

## Inline and fullscreen modes

- **Inline (default)**: content remains on the main screen, and the terminal
  emulator owns scrollback and native text selection.
- **Fullscreen**: `AlternateScreen` switches to the alternate screen, where the
  TUI owns scrolling, mouse selection, OSC 52 copy, and screen restoration.

Both modes share the Channel and React views but use different terminal protocol
paths. Changes involving input, scrolling, mouse, cursor, resize, or cleanup
must be checked in both modes, especially on narrow terminals and Windows
ConPTY.

## Persistence locations

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.dsh/sessions/` | Shared JSONL session events for profile TUI and Web |
| `~/.dsh-tui/sessions/` | JSONL session events for direct `cordis.yml` runs |
| `~/.dsh-tui/resume.txt` | Recent session ID used by the Windows launcher and exit hint |
| `~/.dsh-tui/last-used.json` | `/resume` recency metadata |
| `~/.dsh-tui/theme.json` | Current built-in, static, or plugin theme ID |
| `~/.dsh-tui/themes/` | User theme JSON files; runtime plugin themes do not write here |
| `~/.dsh-tui/working-activity.json` | Activity animation selection |
| `~/.dsh-tui/agent-preset.json` | Default Agent preset for new sessions |

`DSH_TUI_SESSION_ROOT` overrides the JSONL root in either composition. The
profile defaults to `$DSH_HOME/sessions` (normally `~/.dsh/sessions/`);
direct `cordis.yml` runs default to `~/.dsh-tui/sessions/`. Preference files
are optional state: malformed or missing files fall back silently rather than
preventing startup.

The data directory was renamed from `~/.dsh-cc` to `~/.dsh-tui`: on first
launch, if the old directory exists and the new one does not, it is copied
(not moved) to the new location with one notice line; the old directory stays
in place for the user to remove. `resume.txt` is an exception: it is
dual-written to both paths because older launchers only read the old one.

## Permissions and security boundary

`dsh-TUI` does not provide a separate sandbox; it implements the tool-level
approval UI (a CC-style panel answering the `approval/request` waterfall),
while `/permission` preset switching comes from the dsh-base
`permission-presets` row. Effective capability comes from the DSH services
mounted by `cordis.patch.yml`:

- On non-Windows platforms, `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE` defaults to `workspace-write`;
  the filesystem policy requires observed files and the approval policy is
  normally `ask`.
- Windows has no usable local sandbox backend in the current composition, so it
  uses `danger-full-access` and `never` approval to match the terminal trust
  model.
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` should come from the environment or controlled runtime
  injection. Status output only reports presence or a redacted fragment.
- MCP, shell, filesystem tools, and custom presets expand what the model can
  access and should be treated as code-execution surfaces in the same policy
  domain.
- `/permission` reads the mounted DSH `permissionPresets` registry in declared
  order. Third-party presets appear in the picker automatically; only IDs that
  fit the existing command-token grammar enter Tab completion. `custom` is a
  current-state projection, never a selectable target.
- The TUI distinguishes `runtime`, `legacy`, and `unavailable`: the legacy
  three-row roster is used only when the service is truly absent. A mounted
  service that is empty, inconsistent, broken, or unsafe fails closed instead
  of inferring identity from sandbox/approval knobs. All switches still call
  the official `/permission <preset>` command.

Inspect the active profile patch before running in an untrusted repository; the
visual TUI alone does not describe the effective policy.

## Known limitations

- Plugin-source context injected into the system prompt is not shown as a
  separate UI segment; it is included in the system/context meter.
- `/model` switches through a session fork rather than an in-place update; the
  old session remains in `/resume`.
- `Ctrl+V` clipboard reads dispatch per platform: PowerShell `Get-Clipboard` on
  Windows (a competing process can lock the clipboard and make the read appear
  empty after retries), `osascript`/`pbpaste` on macOS, and the first usable of
  `wl-paste`/`xclip`/`xsel` on Linux/Unix (missing tools are skipped, an
  unreachable session falls through to the next candidate, and paste reports
  no usable clipboard tool when all fail). Clipboard images are exported to
  a temp file whose path is inserted (0700 private directory, 0600 file);
  they are not embedded as image blocks.
- Exit restores the terminal and ends the process without waiting for the
  Agent's asynchronous flush; the persistence plugin is the fallback.
- The tool-level approval panel is implemented (approval service + TUI
  answerer); `/permission` preset switching is provided by the dsh-base
  `permission-presets` plugin and works in profile compositions. When that
  registry service is absent, TUI uses its legacy three-row compatibility roster;
  a malformed mounted service is unavailable and fails closed. If the external
  `/permission` command is not registered, input follows the existing
  default/model dispatch behavior.
- `/vim`, `/connect`, and `/hooks` are compatibility placeholders,
  not evidence that those DSH capabilities are mounted.
- There is no automated full-flow suite that requires real model credentials;
  CI uses headless rendering and fake services, while live model integration
  still needs a manual check in the target terminal.

## Debugging and verification

| Goal | Method |
| --- | --- |
| Environment and profile | Run `/doctor`, `/config`, and `/permission status` inside the TUI |
| stderr diagnostics | `DSH_TUI_DEBUG=1 dsh --profile dsh-tui` |
| Raw ANSI frames | `DSH_TUI_RENDER_LOG=/path/to/render.log dsh --profile dsh-tui` |
| Theme regression | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-themes.mjs` |

`DSH_TUI_RENDER_LOG` and session exports may contain sensitive content. Redact
them before sharing.
